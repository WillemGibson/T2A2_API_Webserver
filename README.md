### Testing & Usage

Using an API client such as Postman or Insomnia (My personal choice), import ***endpoints.json** to import all endpoints.

### Reason for creation

This project is a Content Management System (CMS) designed to house and arrange the users' thoughts on anime & manga. This project came to me after attempting to use similar platforms such as ***"myAnimeList"*** and ***AniList*** and being unsatisfied with the lack of customization. So I decided to create my own anime review management system to help me and many others create a collection of thoughts and reviews of all the anime/manga they read/watch.

### Why does this problem matter?

The anime community stands as a vibrant and passionate collection of people, united by their deep love and appreciation for the art form. This dedicated community deserves a platform that not only acknowledges their enthusiasm but also provides a space for them to express their thoughts, opinions, and reviews in a meaningful way.
